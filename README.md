## Project Folder Structure

The repository contains the full codes used and the full data that can be used to train/test the model.

1) [`Images`](./training_images): Images used in this repository
1) [`Training and Testing`](Run_localization.ipynb): The full code that is used to train on the data and test some results.
1) [`Label Data`](Label_data.ipynb): This is a code that creates training data out of images. Can be used to create your own costumize dataset :)
